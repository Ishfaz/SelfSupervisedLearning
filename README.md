# Self-Supervised Learning Lab

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook focused on self-supervised learning techniques, particularly in the context of learning representations from unlabelled data. The lab explores different self-supervised models and techniques with a strong focus on natural language processing tasks.

## Objectives
- **Learn to Use Self-Supervised Models**: Implement and adapt various self-supervised models to generate and analyze text embeddings.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Apply PCA and t-SNE for visualization to understand the spatial arrangement of embeddings and discover inherent patterns.
- **Enhance Understanding Through Experiments**: Engage with advanced tasks that challenge the conventional usage of embeddings and explore the relationship between different linguistic units.
